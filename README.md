# Hotel-Booking-Cancellations-Pandas-Project

Recently, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have been experiencing high cancellation rates. As a result, the hotels are facing several issues, such as reduced revenue and suboptimal use of hotel rooms. Therefore, their primary goal is to reduce cancellation rates to increase revenue efficiency. To address these issues, we need to provide comprehensive business advice.  
The reports will focus on analyzing hotel booking management and other relevant factors that affect their business and yearly revenue generation.


# Assumptions:
1. No unexpected events occurred between 2015 and 2017 that may significantly affect the data used. 
2. The information is up-to-date, and hotels can use it to analyze a possible plan effectively. 
3. There are no unforeseen negatives in adopting any of the recommended techniques. 
4. Hotels are not currently utilizing any of the suggested solutions. 
5. The most significant factor affecting the earning income's efficiency is booking cancellations. 
6. Cancellations lead to unoccupied rooms for the booked duration. 
7. Clients cancel their hotel bookings within the same year they make a reservation.


# Research Question:
1. What factors lead to hotel reservation cancellations? 
2. How can we make hotel reservation cancellations better?
3. How can hotels receive assistance in pricing and promotions?


# Hypothesis:
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
